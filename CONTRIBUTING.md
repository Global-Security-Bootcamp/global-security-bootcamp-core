# Contributing

Scope: This repo holds the core framework for organizers. Contributions should focus on improving templates, documentation, checks, and automation.

Process
- Open a pull request with a clear description of the change and the affected areas.
- Use the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and reference related issues.
- For documentation changes, include a short summary and, where relevant, a sample rendered output.

Reviews
- Changes require at least one maintainer review and one peer review from an organizer.
- Use small, modular PRs. For larger changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

Documentation updates
- Keep language neutral, concise, and actionable.
- When updating program themes or agendas, provide migration notes for existing events.

Modular improvements
- Prefer non-breaking additions: add new templates or versions instead of replacing live ones.

Translation notes
- Keep a `localization/` folder for localization guides and strings.
- Include the source language copy and a short note about context for translators.
