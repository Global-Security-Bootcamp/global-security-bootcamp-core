# Security

Responsible Disclosure
- If you discover a security issue in core materials, notify the maintainers privately by emailing [INSERT_SECURITY_CONTACT] (replace with org contact).

Handling sensitive information
- Do not include real secrets, credentials, or PII in event materials or sample configs.
- Use anonymized or synthetic data for labs and exercises. When realistic data is necessary, provide clear instructions to host it in isolated, ephemeral environments.

Event incident guidance
- If an event exposes participant data, follow local privacy policies and notify privacy/stewardship leads immediately.

For maintainers
- Use minimal permissions for automation runners and rotate credentials regularly.
