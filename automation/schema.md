# Registration Schema

Minimal registration fields recommended for collection and retention guidance.

- `fullname` (string) — display name; avoid collecting PII beyond name and contact.
- `email` (string) — required for confirmations.
- `affiliation` (string) — optional.
- `consent` (boolean) — opt-in for communications and data retention.

Retention notes: store personal data only as required for event operations. Follow local privacy policies and delete or anonymize registration data after the retention period.
