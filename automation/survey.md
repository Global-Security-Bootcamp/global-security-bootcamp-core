# Survey Guidance

Design short, focused surveys to gather practical feedback (labs, clarity, readiness).

Suggested fields
- Overall satisfaction (1-5)
- Which sessions were most useful?
- Any blockers during labs?
- Consent to share anonymized feedback publicly

Privacy: avoid collecting unnecessary personal data and delete raw responses after analysis unless consented.
