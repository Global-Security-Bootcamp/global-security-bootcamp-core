# Global Security Bootcamp

Welcome to the **Global Security Bootcamp** framework — a community-driven scaffold for organizing and running cloud-security-focused events worldwide.

## What is this?

The Global Security Bootcamp Core is a private repository containing:

- **Reusable templates** for agendas, communications, operations, and slides
- **Documentation** on program themes, event standards, and best practices
- **Guidance** for organizers onboarding, branding, sponsorship, and governance
- **A structured approach** to running inclusive, practical, hands-on security events
