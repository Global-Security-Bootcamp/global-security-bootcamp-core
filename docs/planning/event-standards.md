# Event Standards

These standards ensure Global Security Bootcamp events maintain consistent quality and participant experience across all locations and organizers.

## Program Quality

- **Hands-on learning prioritized**: At least 40% of event time should be dedicated to labs, workshops, or interactive sessions.
- **Balanced session mix**: Include keynotes, deep-dives, labs, panels, and practical demos.
- **Clear session objectives**: Every session should have documented prerequisites and expected outcomes.
- **Practical relevance**: All content should connect to real-world security operations and scenarios.
- **Expert-led sessions**: Speakers should have hands-on operational experience in their topic area.

## Participant Experience

- **Accessibility first**: Ensure sessions have captions, transcripts, or accommodations for diverse needs.
- **Inclusive scheduling**: Consider time zones and attendee locations when planning timing.
- **Clear communication**: Registration, agenda, and logistics should be clearly communicated 4+ weeks before the event.
- **Welcoming environment**: All materials and interactions should reflect the Code of Conduct and inclusive values.
- **Feedback collection**: Gather post-event feedback to improve future events.

## Operational Baseline

- **Registration and privacy**: Collect only necessary personal data; provide a clear privacy statement; delete records after retention period.
- **Day-of runbook**: Have a documented plan with primary and backup contacts, escalation procedures, and contingencies.
- **Code of Conduct**: Clearly communicate expectations and reporting mechanisms; ensure organizers know how to respond to issues.
- **Incident readiness**: Have templates and procedures for documenting and escalating any incidents.
- **Post-event follow-up**: Collect feedback, thank sponsors and speakers, and document lessons learned.
