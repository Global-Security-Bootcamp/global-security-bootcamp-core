- Threat hunting on endpoints

### Cloud Workload Security

**Focus**: Container and VM hardening, runtime protection, and threat modeling.

**Sample sessions**:
- Kubernetes and container security
- Virtual machine hardening in cloud
- Runtime threat detection
- Cloud-native vulnerability management

### SIEM / SOAR

**Focus**: Log ingestion, alert tuning, and security automation.

**Sample sessions**:
- Designing an effective SIEM strategy
- Alert tuning and false-positive reduction
- SOAR playbook automation
- Log aggregation and retention

### Secure DevOps

**Focus**: Secure CI/CD pipelines, software composition analysis, and secrets management.

**Sample sessions**:
- Securing your CI/CD pipeline
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security
- Software composition analysis (SCA)
- Secrets management in DevOps

### Data Security & Compliance

**Focus**: Data classification, encryption, privacy-by-design, and regulatory mapping.

**Sample sessions**:
- Data classification frameworks
- Encryption and key management
- Privacy-by-design principles
- Compliance mapping (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

### AI Risk & Governance

**Focus**: Model risk management, data lineage, and prompt-security considerations.

**Sample sessions**:
- AI model security and validation
- Large Language Model (LLM) risk management
- Prompt injection and adversarial testing
- AI governance and compliance

### Zero Trust

**Focus**: Segmentation, least privilege, and continuous verification.

**Sample sessions**:
- Zero Trust architecture principles
- Micro-segmentation strategies
- Continuous verification and authentication
- Implementing least privilege access

## Session Format Recommendations

- **Keynote** (30-45 min): Set context and threat landscape.
- **Hands-on Lab** (60-90 min): Scenario-driven, practical exercises.
- **Workshop** (60 min): Interactive deep-dive with audience participation.
- **Panel** (45 min): Multi-speaker discussion on a topic.
- **Lightning Talk** (10-15 min): Brief, focused insights.
- **Demo** (15-20 min): Live or recorded demonstration.

## Mixing and Matching

- **Half-day event**: Keynote + 2 labs + 1 panel + closing.
- **Full-day event**: Keynote + 3 sessions + lunch + 2-3 labs + panel + closing.
- **Multi-day bootcamp**: Distribute themes across days, with labs rotating daily.

## Audience Level

- **Beginners**: Focus on foundational concepts, broad coverage.
- **Intermediate**: Mix of hands-on labs and operational best practices.
- **Advanced**: Deep technical dives, scenario-based exercises, threat modeling.

## Tips for Session Selection

1. **Know your audience**: Tailor themes and depth to attendee experience level.
2. **Balance breadth and depth**: Mix overview sessions with hands-on labs.
3. **Encourage hands-on learning**: Prioritize labs and interactive sessions.
4. **Provide real-world context**: Use scenarios and case studies from actual incidents.
5. **Align with local interests**: Emphasize themes relevant to your community's industries or challenges.
