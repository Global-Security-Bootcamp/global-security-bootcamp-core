# Agenda Templates

## Overview

The Global Security Bootcamp provides two agenda templates:

- **Full-day agenda** — 8-9 hours with keynote, multiple sessions, labs, and panels
- **Half-day agenda** — 4 hours with keynote, 1-2 sessions, and closing

Both templates emphasize hands-on learning and practical content.

## Full-Day Agenda Template

Use this for 8-9 hour events:

```
09:00 — 09:30 | Registration / Welcome
09:30 — 10:15 | Keynote: Context & Threat Landscape
10:15 — 11:00 | Track A: Workshop / Track B: Panel
11:00 — 11:15 | Break
11:15 — 12:30 | Hands-on labs (scenario-driven)
12:30 — 13:30 | Lunch
13:30 — 15:00 | Deep-dive sessions / breakout labs
15:00 — 15:15 | Break
15:15 — 16:00 | Demos & lightning talks
16:00 — 16:45 | Panel: Operations & Incident Response
16:45 — 17:00 | Closing / Feedback
```

### Customization Tips

- **Replace "Keynote" title** with your speaker and topic, e.g., "Keynote: Identity in Zero Trust".
- **Update track names** with your session topics, e.g., "Track A: Cloud Workload Security Lab, Track B: SIEM Deployment Panel".
- **Add speaker names** for each session.
- **Include session descriptions** below timing blocks with prerequisites and outcomes.

### Example Customization

```
09:00 — 09:30 | Registration / Welcome
09:30 — 10:15 | Keynote: Evolving Threat Landscape in Cloud
            Speaker: Alice Chen (CISO, TechCorp)
            Outcomes: Understand current threat trends and bootcamp focus areas
10:15 — 11:00 | Track A: Kubernetes Security Workshop / Track B: Cloud Workload Panel
            Track A: Hands-on hardening of Kubernetes clusters
            Prerequisites: Basic Kubernetes familiarity
            Track B: Multi-speaker discussion on container runtime protection

09:15 — 10:00 | Keynote / Foundations
10:00 — 11:15 | Hands-on lab / workshop

11:30 — 12:15 | Demos or panel
12:15 — 12:45 | Lightning talks / Q&A
12:45 — 13:00 | Closing & feedback
```

### Customization Tips

- **Keynote** (45 min): Set context or cover one major topic.
- **Lab/Workshop** (75 min): Core hands-on learning session.
- **Demos or Panel** (45 min): Practical applications or expert discussion.
- **Lightning talks** (30 min): 3-4 speakers, 10 min each.

### Example Customization

```
09:00 — 09:15 | Welcome & objectives
            "Today we'll cover incident response fundamentals and run a live response scenario"
09:15 — 10:00 | Keynote: Incident Response Frameworks
            Speaker: Bob Smith (Head of Security, CloudOrg)
10:00 — 11:15 | Hands-on lab: Responding to a Simulated Cloud Breach
            Prerequisites: Basic Linux command line
            Setup: Pre-configured lab environment
11:15 — 11:30 | Break
11:30 — 12:15 | Panel: Response Tools and Automation
            Panelists: Carol (SIEM admin), Dave (incident responder), Eve (SOC manager)
12:15 — 12:45 | Lightning talks: Response stories from the field
12:45 — 13:00 | Closing & feedback
```

## Session Description Template

For each session, include:

```markdown
### [Session Title]

**Speaker(s)**: [Names]
**Duration**: [XX minutes]
**Level**: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
**Format**: [Keynote / Lab / Workshop / Panel / Lightning Talk / Demo]

**Prerequisites**:
- [Prerequisite 1, e.g., "basic cloud knowledge"]
- [Prerequisite 2, e.g., "familiar with command line"]

**Outcomes**:
- [Outcome 1: attendees will be able to...]
- [Outcome 2: attendees will understand...]

**Description**:
[1-2 sentence summary of session content]

**Materials**:
- [Link to slides, lab instructions, etc.]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with welcome/context** — Help attendees understand the event flow and expectations.
2. **Lead with engaging keynote** — Set energy and provide context for later sessions.
3. **Hands-on labs in the middle** — When attendees are most focused (post-breakfast, pre-lunch fatigue).
4. **Include breaks** — 15-min breaks every 90 minutes.
5. **End with energy** — Use lightning talks or closing panel to re-energize before end.
6. **Allow flex time** — Buffer 10-15 min for overruns and Q&A.
