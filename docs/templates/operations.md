## Best Practices

1. **Communicate early and often** — Send schedule updates to all speakers and team members 1 week before.
2. **Have backups** — For speakers, tech, and key roles.
3. **Delegate clearly** — Assign specific roles to volunteers; provide written instructions.
4. **Brief your team** — 30-minute team huddle morning-of to confirm roles and procedures.
5. **Stay flexible** — Have contingency plans for common issues (no-shows, tech failures, time overruns).
6. **Document everything** — Use the Incident Brief template to capture any issues for learning.
