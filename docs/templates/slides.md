3. **Engage the audience** — Ask questions, invite discussion, encourage note-taking.
4. **Use the speaker notes** — Don't read slides verbatim; expand on talking points.
5. **Watch your timing** — Use a timer; leave 5-10 min for Q&A at the end.
6. **Be prepared for tech issues** — Have a backup (PDF of slides, printed notes).
