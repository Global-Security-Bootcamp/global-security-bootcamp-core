## Communication Tips

1. **Communicate early and often** — Speakers, volunteers, sponsors, and attendees benefit from early and clear communication.
2. **Set expectations clearly** — Be explicit about roles, timing, and deliverables.
3. **Create feedback loops** — Ask for input from team members, speakers, and attendees.
4. **Document decisions** — Keep a shared document of event decisions (dates, speakers, budget, etc.).
5. **Be inclusive** — Invite participation from community members and diverse backgrounds.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Speaker cancels last minute | Have backup speaker or redistribute topic across other sessions |
| Low registration | Extend deadline; reach out to local security groups; offer virtual option if possible |
| Tech failure (AV, Wi-Fi) | Have backup (printed handouts, laptop without Wi-Fi, projector backup) |
| Attendee accessibility need | Work with venue to provide accommodation; have captions or transcript ready |
| Over budget | Reduce catering, recruit more volunteer support, seek additional sponsor |
