# Branding

Consistent branding helps build recognition and trust across Global Security Bootcamp events worldwide while allowing local customization.

## Naming Convention

Use this naming pattern for your event:

**"Global Security Bootcamp — [City/Organization] [Year]"**

Examples:
- Global Security Bootcamp — Perth 2025
- Global Security Bootcamp — Silicon Valley 2025
- Global Security Bootcamp — ACME Corp 2025

## Logo and Visuals

### Core Logo

The Global Security Bootcamp has a core logo that should be used in all events. Request the logo files from the stewardship team.

### Local Branding

You may add local branding (city logo, organization logo, sponsor logos) **below or beside** the core logo, not overlapping or integrated. Keep visual hierarchy clear: Global Security Bootcamp is primary.

### Color Palette

**Recommended primary colors**:
- Dark blue (e.g., #003366)
- Light gray or white background
- Accent color: orange or teal

**Accessibility**: Ensure text has high contrast (WCAG AA minimum). Use patterns or labels in addition to color.

## Co-Branding with Sponsors

### Logo Usage Agreement

Before using a sponsor's logo:
- [ ] Obtain written approval and usage rights
- [ ] Confirm duration of usage (event only, or ongoing?)
- [ ] Verify logo file format and version
- [ ] Document any size/placement restrictions

### Placement Guidelines

- **Primary sponsor**: Logo on website, social media, opening slide
- **Supporting sponsor**: Logo in event materials or acknowledgments
- **Booth sponsor**: Logo on booth signage and event materials

**Rule**: Keep sponsor presence **separate from learning materials**. Don't integrate sponsor logos into lab slides or speaker notes.

### Sample Co-Branding Footer

```
[Core Logo]  |  Global Security Bootcamp — [City] 2025  |  [Sponsor Logo] [Sponsor Logo]
```

## Website and Social Media

### Domain

- **Preferred**: `[city]-bootcamp-2025.github.io` (GitHub Pages)
- **Alternative**: Subdomain on your organization's site (e.g., `security.yourorg.com/bootcamp`)

### Social Media Handles

Use consistent naming:
- **Twitter / X**: `@GSBootcamp[City]` or `@[YourOrg]Security`
- **LinkedIn**: "Global Security Bootcamp — [City]"
- **Slack**: `#bootcamp-[city]`

### Hashtags

- Primary: `#GlobalSecurityBootcamp`
- Local: `#[City]Security` or `#[CityName]Tech`
- Topic-specific: `#CloudSecurity` `#IncidentResponse` (as relevant)

## Slide Templates

All slides should follow this basic style:

1. **Consistent header/footer** with event name, date, and page number
2. **Core color palette** (dark blue, white, accent color)
3. **Clear, readable fonts** (sans-serif preferred; ≥ 24pt body, ≥ 32pt headers)
4. **Minimal branding** — Don't clutter slides with logos; use event branding consistently at start/end

## Print Materials

If printing agendas, name badges, or signage:

- [ ] Use core logo and consistent color palette
- [ ] Include event name, date, location
- [ ] Add local organizer contact info
- [ ] Ensure high contrast and readability

## Trademark and Legal

- **"Global Security Bootcamp"** is a community brand. Use it freely for events aligned with our values and standards.
- **Sponsors' logos** — Always get written permission before using.
- **Attendee photos** — Get consent before sharing on social media or in marketing materials.

## Customization Checklist

Before launching your event materials:

- [ ] Event name follows "Global Security Bootcamp — [City/Org] [Year]" format
- [ ] Core logo is present and unmodified
- [ ] Local branding (if any) is separate and doesn't dominate
- [ ] Sponsor logos have written approval and clear placement
- [ ] Color palette matches recommended style (high contrast, accessible)
- [ ] Social media handles and hashtags are consistent
- [ ] Website/GitHub Pages uses consistent domain naming
- [ ] Print materials are reviewed for clarity and branding
