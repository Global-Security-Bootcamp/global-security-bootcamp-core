# Start a Global Security Bootcamp Event

You've decided to organize a Global Security Bootcamp event in your city — **awesome!**

We're excited to have community leaders like you help build hands-on cloud security learning opportunities worldwide. We've designed this program to make launching your event as smooth and straightforward as possible. With the right resources, team, and support, your first event will inspire and equip security professionals in your area, creating momentum for future events. Let's get started the right way!

The Global Security Bootcamp is your gateway into a thriving community of security engineers, architects, and practitioners.

## Guidelines for Starting Your Event

When you organize a Global Security Bootcamp event, you'll be helping build a hands-on security learning community in your location.

A Global Security Bootcamp event is not a one-time workshop or meetup. We expect **ongoing commitment** to deliver high-quality, hands-on security education in your area. The ideal cadence is **one major event per year**, with smaller follow-up workshops or lab sessions throughout.

We require **at least two organizers** in your group to share responsibilities and prevent burnout. Co-organizers bring complementary skills (e.g., content expertise, operations, sponsorship) and ensure continuity if someone needs to step back.

When requesting an event, we ask that it be **locally focused** — hosted in a specific city or region with a defined target audience (e.g., "Toronto-based security professionals"). If an event already exists in your city, we may discuss overlap and collaboration rather than duplicating efforts.

**Hands-on learning is mandatory** — at least 40% of your event should be dedicated to labs, workshops, or interactive exercises. This differentiates us from lecture-only conferences and creates lasting learning impact.

## Benefits for Event Organizers

As an organizer of a Global Security Bootcamp event, you get support to help you succeed:

• **Provisioned Event Repository** — We create and configure a GitHub repository pre-seeded with templates, guides, and operational checklists, saving you setup time.

• **Reusable Templates** — Access to agendas, slide decks, speaker notes, lab instructions, communications templates, and day-of runbooks. Customize them for your city and context.

• **Branding and Design Assets** — Professional logos, email signatures, social media templates, and design guidelines to maintain consistency across the Global Security Bootcamp network.

• **Global Community Network** — Join a network of 100+ organizers worldwide who share lessons, speaker recommendations, and best practices through our community channels.

• **Speaker and Facilitator Matching** — Post your speaker needs in community channels; other organizers may recommend trusted voices or volunteer to deliver sessions.

• **Sponsorship Guidance** — Templates for sponsorship packages, prospecting lists, and negotiation frameworks to help you fund your event sustainably.

• **Accessibility and Localization Support** — Resources for adding captions, transcripts, translations, and accommodations to reach diverse audiences.

• **Marketing and Communications** — Pre-drafted press releases, email templates, social media content, and amplification through Global Security Bootcamp channels.

• **Post-Event Amplification** — Share your event highlights, lessons learned, and speaker content through the Global Security Bootcamp community platform and newsletter to reach a global audience.

## Role and Responsibilities of Event Organizers

As an organizer, you agree to the following responsibilities:

### 1. Build and Maintain Your Team

You will recruit and manage a core organizing team (minimum two co-organizers) with complementary skills. You are responsible for communicating any changes to your organizing team (new organizers, departures, role shifts) to the stewardship team.

### 2. Deliver Hands-On Learning

You will ensure that at least 40% of your event is dedicated to labs, workshops, and interactive exercises. Speakers are responsible for delivering content, but organizers ensure labs are tested, facilitated, and feedback-ready.

### 3. Maintain Event Quality

You will follow the [Event Standards](../planning/event-standards.md) checklist before launching your event, including accessibility accommodations, clear communication, Code of Conduct visibility, and feedback collection.

### 4. Be Inclusive and Welcoming

You will design your event with open registration and free or low-cost attendance. All marketing, communications, and in-person interactions should reflect our inclusive values and Code of Conduct.

### 5. Ensure Participant Safety

All Global Security Bootcamp events are governed by the [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct.md). You will make the Code of Conduct publicly visible, train your team on reporting mechanisms, and be prepared to respond to any incidents.

### 6. Represent the Brand Authentically

You will use Global Security Bootcamp branding, templates, and communications guidelines consistently. All communications about your event (GitHub, email, social media, press) should represent the program accurately and align with our shared values.

### 7. Operate Transparently and Sustainably

You will not use the event for direct commercial gain. Events should be not-for-profit with transparent budgeting. Partner with sponsors for funding, but do not sell attendee data or restrict access to paid tiers.

### 8. Give Back to the Community

You will document and share your event's materials, lessons learned, and speaker insights with the Global Security Bootcamp community. This helps future organizers and amplifies impact globally.

## Process Overview

Ready to organize a Global Security Bootcamp event?

• **Join the Community** — First, [join our GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/global-security-bootcamp/global-security-bootcamp-core/discussions) and head to the `#new-events` channel. Connect with experienced organizers, ask questions, and get mentorship on starting your event.

• **Submit Your Event Request** — Once you're ready, [fill out an Event Repository Request](https://github.com/global-security-bootcamp/global-security-bootcamp-core/issues/new?template=event-repo-request.md) with your event details, organizer team, and timeline.

• **Stewardship Review** — We review new event requests monthly. If you submit your request in January, expect review in February. We'll confirm your request, ask clarifying questions if needed, and discuss next steps.

• **Repository Provisioning** — Once approved, we create and configure your event repository, pre-seed it with templates, add collaborators, and send you a welcome package with onboarding guidance.

• **Get Onboarded** — Complete the [Event Organizer Onboarding checklist](event-organizer-onboarding.md) to set up your GitHub repository, customize templates, and prepare your team.

• **Build Your Event** — Recruit speakers, finalize labs, set up registration, and confirm sponsors using the templates and guidelines provided.

• **Deliver and Learn** — Host your event, collect feedback, and document lessons learned for the community.

**Important:** Do not create your own event repository or set up your own GitHub organization. Let the stewardship team provision and configure your repository to ensure consistency, compliance, and proper access controls.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Question: How much does it cost to organize a Global Security Bootcamp event?**

Answer: There is no cost to organize an event. The Global Security Bootcamp is run by volunteers. We provide templates and guidance; you recruit speakers, volunteers, and sponsors locally to cover costs (venue, catering, software licenses, etc.). Sponsorship guidance is included.

**Question: Do all event requests get approved?**

Answer: Most requests are approved, but not all. Common reasons for reconsidering a request: insufficient organizing team (fewer than two organizers), an active event already planned for your city within 12 months, or unclear commitment to hands-on learning. If your request isn't approved immediately, we'll offer guidance on how to strengthen it.

**Question: Can I convert my existing security workshop or meetup into a Global Security Bootcamp event?**

Answer: Yes, absolutely. If you have an established security learning group or annual workshop, you can align it with Global Security Bootcamp standards and request to join the network. We'll review to ensure it meets hands-on learning and inclusive participation requirements.

**Question: What kinds of activities count as "hands-on learning"?**

Answer: Labs (hands-on cloud environments), workshops (small group problem-solving), demos (live security tools and scenarios), breakout discussions, and interactive exercises all count. Lecture-only sessions do not count toward the 40% threshold.

**Question: Can the Global Security Bootcamp provide sponsorship or funding?**

Answer: No, the Global Security Bootcamp does not provide financial support or direct funding. However, we provide sponsorship prospecting templates, negotiation frameworks, and introductions to aligned vendors. You are responsible for securing sponsors locally.

**Question: What if my event location has limited security professionals or small attendee numbers?**

Answer: We're inclusive of different event sizes. A smaller local event is valuable! We recommend hybrid or virtual options to reach beyond your immediate geography. Talk to experienced organizers in similar regions for strategies.

**Question: How long does the approval and provisioning process take?**

Answer: Event requests are reviewed monthly; approval typically takes 2–4 weeks from submission to repository provisioning. Once your repository is ready, you can begin customizing templates and recruiting your team.

**Question: Can I have a private (non-public) event repository?**

Answer: Yes. Your event repository can be private if you're dealing with sensitive internal materials or corporate partnerships. Let us know in your request, and we'll configure accordingly.

**Question: Where does the Global Security Bootcamp get its support and funding?**

Answer: The Global Security Bootcamp is supported by cloud security vendors, educational sponsors, and the volunteer community. See the [Sponsorship](../sponsorship.md) page for information on sponsors and partnership opportunities.
