# Sponsorship

Strategic sponsorship helps fund and amplify Global Security Bootcamp events. This guide outlines principles, tiers, and expectations.

## Sponsorship Principles

1. **Support learning and access** — Sponsors should enable practical education, not vendor lock-in.
2. **Transparency** — Sponsorship agreements should be explicit about deliverables and duration.
3. **Community-first** — Sponsors amplify the event; they don't own or control it.
4. **Balanced value** — Ensure sponsorship benefits attendees and doesn't overshadow the bootcamp itself.

## Sponsor Recruitment Tips

1. **Start early** — Contact sponsors 2-3 months before event for major sponsorship.
2. **Be specific** — Clearly state what sponsorship covers (catering, venue, AV, travel).
3. **Highlight alignment** — Explain how their support enables practical security education in the community.
4. **Provide clear deliverables** — Use the tier definitions above to set expectations.
5. **Engage locally** — Start with companies/organizations that have staff in your city or region.
6. **Offer multiple tiers** — Not all sponsors can afford Principal level; offer Supporter and Partner options.

## Sponsor Communication

### Pre-Event

- Week 12: Reach out with sponsorship overview and tiers
- Week 8: Follow up with interested prospects; send formal agreement
- Week 4: Confirm speakers (if applicable), get logos, finalize deliverables
- Week 1: Send event schedule and logistics to sponsors

### Event Day

- Acknowledge sponsors from stage during opening/closing
- Provide prominent signage or table display
- Ensure sponsored materials are visible and accessible

### Post-Event

- Send thank-you email with attendance numbers and feedback summary
- Share photos (with consent) featuring sponsor logos/presence
- Offer to include sponsor link/logo in event post-mortem or recap
- Invite sponsor feedback on their experience

## Decline or Conflict of Interest

You may decline a sponsorship if:
- Sponsor's values conflict with bootcamp principles (inclusivity, practical learning, community-first)
- Proposed activity (e.g., sales pitch) violates bootcamp standards
- Sponsor is a direct competitor to other sponsors

**Handle professionally**: Explain the conflict clearly and offer alternative (e.g., smaller tier, non-speaking sponsorship).

## Tax and Legal

- **Confirm tax status**: Is your event a non-profit? Private event? Understand tax implications for sponsorship.
- **Get agreements in writing**: Avoid misunderstandings with a simple signed agreement.
- **Disclose sponsorships**: Be transparent with attendees about sponsor support.
