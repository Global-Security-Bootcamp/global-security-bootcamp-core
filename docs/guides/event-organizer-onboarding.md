# Event Organizer Onboarding

Welcome to the Global Security Bootcamp. This page covers everything you need to set up your event repository, configure your team, and get ready to launch.

## 1. Set Up Essentials

### Organize Your Core Team

• Confirm your co-organizers (minimum two) and their roles (lead organizer, operations lead, speaker lead, etc.)
• Add all organizers to your GitHub event repository as collaborators
• Create a shared document (GitHub Wiki, Google Doc, or Notion) for team communication and decisions
• Schedule a kickoff meeting to align on dates, venue, target audience, and budget

### GitHub Repository Access

• You've received your provisioned event repository (named like `yourcity-bootcamp-YYYY`)
• Verify you have admin access and can add team members
• Review the pre-populated folder structure: `/agendas`, `/speakers`, `/labs`, `/communications`, `/operations`
• Customize the `README.md` with your event-specific details (dates, location, organizers, contact info)

### Create Your Event Channel

• Set up a **GitHub Discussion** or **GitHub Issues** board for your team to track tasks, speaker confirmations, and decisions
• Alternatively, use a shared document or project management tool (Notion, Asana, etc.) for internal coordination
• Ensure all team members have access and know how to use it

## 2. Define Your Event

### Event Fundamentals

• Confirm **event dates** (target: one full-day or two half-day event)
• Choose **location** (in-person venue, hybrid, or fully virtual)
• Define **target audience** (e.g., "Toronto-based cloud security engineers and architects")
• Set **attendance goal** (realistic for your market and resources)
• Establish **budget** and identify funding sources (sponsors, participant fees if any)

### Program Planning

• Review [Program Themes](../planning/program-themes.md) and select 3–5 security topics aligned with your audience
• Define your agenda structure (keynote, breakout sessions, labs, panels, etc.)
• Aim for **at least 40% hands-on time** (labs, workshops, interactive exercises)
• Copy relevant templates from `GlobalSecurityBootcampTemplate/templates/` into your repository (agendas, speaker briefs, lab instructions)

### Speaker and Facilitator Recruitment

• Identify 5–10 potential speakers (local experts, community voices, vendor representatives)
• Reach out with a speaker brief including topic, audience level, time allocation, and expectations
• Post speaker needs in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/global-security-bootcamp/global-security-bootcamp-core/discussions) to crowdsource recommendations
• Confirm speaker availability and collect speaker bios, headshots, and social media handles

## 3. Update Your GitHub Repository

### Customize Your Repository

• Update `README.md` with:
  - Event dates, location, and time zone
  - Organizer names and contact info
  - Registration link (when ready)
  - Event agenda (high-level structure)

• Create or customize your `/agendas` folder:
  - Copy the relevant agenda template for your event type
  - Add session titles, speaker names, times, and room locations
  - Include session descriptions and learning objectives

• Create your `/speakers` folder:
  - Add a profile for each speaker with bio, headshot, and social links
  - Include speaker confirmation status and any special requirements (AV, setup time)

• Create your `/labs` folder:
  - Copy lab templates and instructions from `GlobalSecurityBootcampTemplate/templates/labs/`
  - Test labs in your target environment (cloud platform, on-prem, etc.)
  - Document prerequisites and expected setup time

• Create your `/communications` folder:
  - Copy email templates from `GlobalSecurityBootcampTemplate/templates/communications/`
  - Prepare social media announcements, press release, and speaker talking points
  - Schedule communications timeline (4 weeks before, 2 weeks, 1 week, event week)

• Create your `/operations` folder:
  - Copy the day-of runbook from `GlobalSecurityBootcampTemplate/templates/operations/`
  - Customize with your venue details, primary contacts, escalation procedures, and contingencies
  - Add accessibility accommodations and setup requirements

## 4. Set Up Registration

Please make a request to the stewardship team for guidance on your registration platform. Options include:

• **Eventbrite** (free or paid, integrates with social)
• **GitHub Issues** (lightweight, good for small events)
• **Google Forms** (simple, free)
• **Meetup.com** (good for ongoing community events)

Your registration form should:

• Collect attendee name, email, organization, and role
• Ask about dietary restrictions and accessibility needs
• Include a link to your Code of Conduct and privacy statement
• Request permission to record and share content

**Privacy:** Be transparent about data collection and retention. Delete or anonymize attendee data within 30 days of your event unless attendees opt in for future communications.

## 5. Important Resources
