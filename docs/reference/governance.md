# Governance

The Global Security Bootcamp is stewarded by a governance model focused on sustainability, inclusivity, and continuous improvement.

## Stewardship Model

### Roles

**Stewardship Team**
- Maintains the core framework (templates, docs, standards)
- Reviews and approves major changes
- Supports organizers with guidance and best practices
- Manages contributor reviews and merge decisions

**Event Organizers**
- Plan and execute local events using the framework
- Customize templates and content for their context
- Contribute feedback and improvements back

**Contributors**
- Submit templates, guides, or improvements via pull requests
- Engage in code review and feedback

### Decision-Making

- **Minor changes** (docs, typos, small improvements): Reviewed by one maintainer, merged quickly
- **Major changes** (new program themes, template overhauls): Discussed in an issue, reviewed by 2+ maintainers, approved by stewardship lead
- **Policy changes** (standards, governance): Discussed with organizers; stewardship lead approves

### Review Cycle

**Quarterly** (every 3 months):
- Review program themes and templates for relevance and accuracy
- Collect feedback from organizers and attendees
- Plan improvements for next quarter

**Annually** (every 12 months):
- Comprehensive review of standards and governance
- Major version updates or theme additions
- Plan for next year's priorities

## Contributing to the Core Framework

If you've developed improvements, new templates, or program themes:

1. **Open an issue** describing your contribution and the benefits.
2. **Get feedback** from the stewardship team on approach.
3. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reason for contribution
   - Examples or documentation
4. **Respond to reviews** and iterate with feedback.
5. **Merge** once approved by at least one maintainer.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for detailed guidelines.

## Issue Triage

Issues are labeled and prioritized:

| Label | Meaning | Priority |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `onboarding` | Organizer training and guidance | High |
| `event-standards` | Program quality and participant experience | High |
| `templates` | Template improvements or additions | Medium |
| `docs` | Documentation updates or clarity | Medium |
| `good-first-issue` | Good starting point for new contributors | Variable |
| `help-wanted` | Help needed; unclear how to solve | Medium |
| `enhancement` | Feature request or improvement idea | Low |
| `bug` | Something broken or inaccurate | High |

## Code of Conduct

All participants (organizers, contributors, stewardship team) are expected to uphold the values of inclusivity, respect, and community-first approach. See `docs/guides/code-of-conduct.md` for expectations and reporting procedures.

## Communication Channels

- **GitHub issues**: Framework feedback, bug reports, feature requests
- **Pull requests**: Code and doc contributions
- **Email**: Private governance discussions (organizer-to-steward)
- **Quarterly reviews**: Sync with organizers on priorities and feedback

## Sustainability

### How the Framework Stays Current

1. **Regular reviews** from organizers and attendees
2. **Community contributions** of new templates and themes
3. **Feedback loops** after each event
4. **Clear versioning** of major changes

### How Organizers Benefit

- **Reusable templates** reduce planning effort
- **Best practices** from other organizers
- **Community support** and shared learnings
- **Continuous improvement** based on collective experience

## Version Control

- `v1.0` — Initial release with core templates and docs
- `v1.1` — Add new program themes, minor doc updates
