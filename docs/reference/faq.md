# FAQ

## Framework Usage

**Q: What is Global Security Bootcamp?**

A: A community-driven framework for organizing practical, hands-on cloud-security events. It provides reusable templates, documentation, and best practices so organizers can launch consistent events in their cities while maintaining shared values.

**Q: Can I use the framework for my event?**

A: Yes, if you've been invited by the stewardship team or your organization. The framework is designed for organizers who will follow the core standards and contribute back if desired. Contact the stewardship team if interested.

**Q: Do I have to follow all the templates exactly?**

A: No. Templates are starting points. Customize them for your city, audience, and topics. However, all events should meet the baseline standards in `docs/event-standards.md`.

**Q: How is this different from a standard conference?**

A: Bootcamp emphasizes **hands-on learning** and **practical skills** over vendor pitches or slide decks. Labs and scenario-driven exercises should make up 40%+ of the event.

## Event Planning

**Q: How long does it take to plan an event?**

A: Typically 3-6 months, depending on scope:
- **3 months**: Small, local event with 2-3 speakers and 1-2 labs
- **6 months**: Larger event with 6+ speakers, multiple tracks, and complex logistics

**Q: How many people should attend?**

A: Any size is valid. Events can range from 30-40 local practitioners to 200+. Consider your venue, volunteer capacity, and speaker availability.

**Q: Do I need sponsors?**

A: Not required, but helpful. Sponsors can cover venue, catering, travel, and AV costs. See `docs/guides/sponsorship.md` for tiers and expectations.

**Q: Should the event be free or paid?**

A: Either works. Free events lower barriers to entry; paid events can cover costs and signal value. Consider your target audience and financial situation.

## Adaptation and Customization

**Q: Can I change the agenda template?**

A: Yes. Use the templates as starting points and customize for your event. Just ensure your agenda is clear (speaker, topic, duration, outcomes).

**Q: How do I adapt topics for my audience?**

A: Review `docs/planning/program-themes.md` for suggested topics, then select based on your audience's interests and experience level. Mix broad overviews (beginner) with deep-dives (advanced).

**Q: Can I add multiple days or tracks?**

A: Yes. Extend the agenda template, provide clear track descriptions, and manage logistics carefully. Use the day-of runbook to handle multiple concurrent sessions.

**Q: What if I want to add new program themes?**

A: Great! Develop your theme (with learning outcomes, sample sessions, and labs), test it at your event, and consider contributing it back to the core framework. See `docs/reference/contributing.md`.

## Ticketing and Registration

**Q: Which registration tool should I use?**

A: Any platform works (Eventbrite, Google Forms, Luma, etc.). The only requirement: collect minimal data, display a privacy statement, and follow retention policies per your jurisdiction.

**Q: What personal data should I collect?**

A: Minimal data:
- Full name (for badges/confirmation)
- Email (for communications)
- Organization (optional, for demographics)
- Consent to communications (opt-in)

Avoid collecting gender, race, or other sensitive data unless you have a specific reason and consent.

**Q: How long can I keep registration data?**

A: Per GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws, no longer than necessary. Common practice: delete data 30-90 days after the event. Document your retention policy in your privacy statement.

## Accessibility and Inclusion

**Q: How do I make the event accessible?**

A: Start with:
- Clear, large fonts in slides (≥ 24pt body, ≥ 32pt headers)
- High contrast (dark text on light or vice versa)
- Captions or transcripts for recorded content
- Reserved seating near AV/screen for attendees with vision loss
- Accessible venue (ramps, accessible restrooms, elevators)
- Parking and public transit info

See `docs/planning/event-standards.md` for full accessibility checklist.

**Q: Should the event be hybrid (in-person + virtual)?**

A: It can be, but requires more planning:
- Multiple cameras for virtual attendees
- Moderation for Q&A across both audiences
- Captions for virtual attendees
- Recording and archival (with consent)

Consider starting in-person only, then adding virtual later if desired.

**Q: How do I handle time zones?**

A: For in-person events, this is usually not an issue. For virtual or hybrid events:
- Host at a time that accommodates your target audience
- Record and share asynchronously if global audience
- Provide session times in multiple time zones on materials

## Sponsorship and Partnerships

**Q: How do I approach sponsors?**

A: Contact prospects 2-3 months before the event. Clearly explain what sponsorship supports (catering, venue, travel, etc.) and what recognition they receive. See `docs/guides/sponsorship.md` for tiers and templates.

**Q: Can a vendor sponsor if they're also a competitor?**

A: Generally yes, but be transparent. Both can co-exist if sponsorship doesn't include speaking slots or booth exclusivity. Use tiering to keep booth presence minimal if needed.

**Q: What if a sponsor wants to pitch their product?**

A: Redirect to educational content. Sponsors can host workshops on practices or open-source tools, but "how to buy our product" talks aren't appropriate for a bootcamp focused on practical learning.

## Post-Event

**Q: How do I gather feedback?**

A: Use a short survey (5-10 questions) covering:
- Overall satisfaction
- Most useful sessions
- Suggestions for improvement
- Accessibility or comfort issues
- Likelihood to attend future events

Collect feedback right after the event (higher response rate) or via email within 1 week.

**Q: What should I do with feedback?**

A: 
1. Analyze and summarize (quantitative scores + qualitative themes)
2. Share results with core team and speakers
3. Document lessons learned for next event
4. Consider contributing improvements back to the core framework

**Q: How should I archive event materials?**

A: Store in your event repo:
- Slide decks (final versions)
- Lab instructions and scripts
- Recordings (if published) with consent
- Attendee feedback summary (anonymized)
- Organizer post-mortem notes

Keep public materials linked from your event repo README.

## Contributing Back

**Q: Can I share improvements or new templates?**

A: Yes! If you develop valuable templates, labs, or program themes, consider contributing them back to the core framework. See `docs/reference/contributing.md` for the process.

**Q: How does the stewardship team review contributions?**

A: We review for:
- Alignment with bootcamp values (inclusive, practical, community-driven)
- Quality and completeness
- Reusability for other organizers
- Clear documentation

Expect feedback and a discussion before merging.

**Q: Do I have to contribute back my materials?**

A: No, it's optional. However, sharing helps the broader community and improves the framework for everyone.
