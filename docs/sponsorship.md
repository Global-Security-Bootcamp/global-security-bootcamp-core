# Sponsorship

Principles
- Sponsors should support access and learning; avoid vendor lock-in.
- Transparency: make sponsor agreements and deliverables explicit.

Suggested tiers
- Supporter: logo on site, one social mention.
- Partner: short talk slot (non-product), logo on slide, social mentions.
- Principal: dedicated workshop sponsorship, co-branded materials.

Deliverables
- Sponsors provide approved assets and one contact for communication.
