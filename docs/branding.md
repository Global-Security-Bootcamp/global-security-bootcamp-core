# Branding Assets and Design Guidelines

Our branding guidelines help you represent the Global Security Bootcamp consistently across all your event materials, communications, and platforms. A unified visual identity strengthens recognition, builds trust, and creates a professional presence for our community worldwide.

Familiarize yourself with these guidelines and refer to them whenever creating materials that represent your Global Security Bootcamp event.

## Logo and Mark

### Logo Usage

- Use the **Global Security Bootcamp logo** on all primary materials: posters, slides, registration pages, event websites, and email headers.
- The logo is available in **full color** for light backgrounds and **white/monochrome** versions for dark backgrounds or print on colored backgrounds.
- Always display the logo in its original proportions — **never stretch, compress, or distort** the design.
- Maintain **clear space** around the logo equal to at least 20% of its height on all sides.
- **Minimum size**: 1 inch (25mm) for print; 100px for digital.

### Do's and Don'ts: Logo Usage

✅ **Do:**
- Use official logo files from the repository
- Maintain clear space around the logo
- Use full color on light backgrounds, white on dark backgrounds
- Scale proportionally
- Place on solid or simple backgrounds with sufficient contrast

❌ **Don't:**
- Stretch, rotate, or skew the logo
- Change colors or add drop shadows
- Place on busy or low-contrast backgrounds
- Resize below minimum dimensions
- Alter the design or combine with other graphics

### Mark (Symbol)

The Global Security Bootcamp mark is a standalone symbol for use in situations where space is limited (e.g., favicons, app icons, small badges).

- **Minimum size**: 24px for digital; 0.5 inches for print
- **Clear space**: At least half the mark's height on all sides
- Never alter colors, proportions, or design elements
- Use on backgrounds with sufficient contrast

## Naming and Naming Conventions

### Event Naming

Use the following naming format for local events:

**`Global Security Bootcamp — [City/Region]`** or **`Global Security Bootcamp [YYYY]`**

Examples:
- Global Security Bootcamp — Toronto 2026
- Global Security Bootcamp — Singapore 2026
- Global Security Bootcamp 2026 (if organizing a region-wide event)

### Organizer Attribution

Always include organizer and speaker attribution in event materials:

- List organizer name(s) and organization (if applicable)
- Include speaker names and titles in agendas and speaker bios
- Credit sponsors prominently (see Co-branding section below)
- Use consistent naming across all platforms (website, email, social media, slides)

## Typography

Clear, readable typography is essential for professional communications.

### Font Stack

- **Display/Headings**: Use sans-serif fonts like **Lato**, **Roboto**, or **Open Sans** (if specific fonts unavailable, use system sans-serif defaults)
- **Body Text**: Use **Montserrat**, **Open Sans**, or **Roboto** for body copy and smaller text
- **Code/Technical**: Use monospace fonts like **Courier New**, **Consolas**, or **Monaco** for code examples and terminal output

### Typography Specifications

| Element | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|---------|------|------|--------|------------|
| Heading 1 | Sans-serif | 40–48px | Bold (700) | 1.2 |
| Heading 2 | Sans-serif | 28–32px | Bold (700) | 1.2 |
| Heading 3 | Sans-serif | 20–24px | Semi-bold (600) | 1.3 |
| Body Text | Sans-serif | 14–16px | Regular (400) | 1.6 |
| Small Text/Caption | Sans-serif | 12–14px | Regular (400) | 1.5 |

### Best Practices
