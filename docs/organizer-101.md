# Event Organization 101

Bringing people together in person is one of the best ways to build and energize your local security community. In-person events foster stronger connections, encourage collaboration, and create a sense of belonging. Whether you're sharing knowledge, working through labs, or networking, these events spark lasting engagement.

Organizing an event may seem daunting at first, but with a clear plan and the right support, it can be straightforward and rewarding. It gets easier as you organize more events. Here's a step-by-step practical guide to help you get started.

## 1. Plan the Event

### Define Your Event Concept

- **Topic or theme** — Choose a focus area: workshop on a specific cloud platform, hands-on labs, panel discussion, keynote + breakouts, or social networking with optional learning
- **Format** — In-person, hybrid, or virtual? Hands-on labs require more infrastructure; talks can be recorded and shared
- **Duration** — Half day (4 hours), full day (8 hours), or multi-part series? Hands-on labs typically need 90 minutes minimum

### Set Timing and Logistics

- **Date and time** — Evenings (6–9 PM) or weekends often work best for working professionals; avoid holidays and competing local events
- **Attendance target** — Start small if it's your first event (30–75 people is a great range); you can scale based on experience and sponsorship
- **Duration** — Plan for at least 40% hands-on time if running labs (per Event Standards)

### Define Your Audience

- **Role levels** — Security engineers, architects, managers, entry-level? Ensure session descriptions clarify prerequisites
- **Geographic scope** — Local city, regional, or willing to go hybrid/virtual?
- **Industry focus** — Open to all, or specific sectors (finance, healthcare, cloud-native companies)?

## 2. Secure a Venue

### Identify Potential Venues

Reach out to:

- **Local tech companies** — Often happy to host community events for visibility and recruitment
- **Co-working spaces** — Usually affordable or willing to provide space in exchange for sponsor credits
- **Universities or training centers** — Educational partnerships; may offer facilities and equipment
- **Security-focused organizations** — Cloud vendors, security consultancies, managed services providers

### Venue Requirements Checklist

- [ ] **Capacity** — Seats 30–100+ depending on expected attendance
- [ ] **WiFi** — Strong, stable internet (test with 1.5x your expected attendee count)
- [ ] **Accessible location** — Easy public transit access, parking, wheelchair accessible
- [ ] **AV equipment** — Projector, screen, audio system (if providing)
- [ ] **Power outlets** — Sufficient for attendee laptops and facilitator equipment
- [ ] **Restroom access** — Clean, accessible facilities
- [ ] **Seating flexibility** — Tables for labs, theater-style for talks, or mixed
- [ ] **Climate control** — Comfortable temperature during event hours

### Timeline

- **Book early** — Aim to lock in venue 6–8 weeks in advance
- **Confirm details** — 4 weeks before: confirm setup time, AV needs, parking, accessibility
- **Walk through** — 1–2 weeks before: test Wi-Fi, AV, seating layout, power availability

## 3. Find Sponsors

Sponsors help fund venue, catering, equipment, and materials. Build mutually beneficial partnerships.

### Types of Sponsorships

- **Venue sponsor** — Provides space in exchange for company name/logo in materials, verbal introduction, or table/booth at event
- **Catering sponsor** — Funds food/drinks in exchange for logo, shout-out, optional brief (2–3 min) company intro
- **Equipment/technology sponsor** — Provides lab environments, cloud credits, software licenses, or AV support
- **Media/promotion sponsor** — Helps amplify marketing; gains visibility in announcements

### Prospecting and Pitching

- **Identify targets** — Companies with security product/service focus, presence in your area, track record of community support
- **Personalize outreach** — Research decision-makers; connect via LinkedIn or personal network if possible
- **Lead with value** — "Reach security professionals in [city]" + "Brand visibility" + audience size and profile
- **Use sponsorship tiers** — Gold ($5K+), Silver ($2–5K), Bronze ($500–2K) — make it easy to say yes at any level
- **Offer clear deliverables** — Logo placement, speaking slot (if applicable), attendee contact list (if appropriate), social media shout-outs

### Written Agreements

Always document sponsorship terms:

- Amount and payment terms
- Logo usage rights and placement
- Speaking/presentation slot (if any), including time limit
- Attendee data sharing (if applicable) and privacy compliance
- Event date, location, expected attendance
- Cancellation and refund policies (if any)

## 4. Recruit Speakers and Facilitators

### Find Speakers
