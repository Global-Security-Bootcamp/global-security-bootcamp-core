# Governance

Stewardship
- The stewardship team maintains core templates, approves program themes, and reviews major changes.

Reviews and improvements
- Regular reviews: quarterly review cycle for program themes and templates.
- Minor fixes: small documentation or template fixes may be merged by maintainers with peer review.

Issue triage
- Use labels `onboarding`, `readiness`, `docs`, and `automation` to organize issues.
