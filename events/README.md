# Events

How to add event materials
- Recommended: create a separate repository per event and link to it from here.
- Required files for an event repo (recommended):
  - `README.md` describing the event
  - `agenda.md` or `agenda/` using templates in `templates/agenda`
  - `slides/` and `labs/` with setup and cleanup instructions
  - `runbook-day-of.md`

Samples are provided in `events/samples/` to illustrate expected structure and content.
