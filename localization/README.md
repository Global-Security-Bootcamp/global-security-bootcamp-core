# Localization

Approach: keep the canonical content in the source language (English) in `docs/` and provide localized strings in `localization/en/` and other language folders.

Structure
- `localization/en/` — source strings and guidelines.
- `scaffold/localization-guide.md` — steps to create translations and maintain parity.
